# FirstRepo
This is my first time creating a repository and i am excited

Now i know the word COMMIT in github simply means saved changes and creating a branch or branches as the case may be makes it easier for you to make adjustments to your code without altering what you have already done in your master repository. Wow, this is amazing, i never knew this until now.

Changes were made to this file, line 4 was included.
